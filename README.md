This is a basic version of the ALU present in a processor that uses
uPower ISA (IBM).
1. uPower ISA only supports integer instructions
2. The instruction size is 32 bits.
3. Most ALU instructions operate on byte, word, halfword and doubleword.
4. Signed integers are represented in two's complement form.
5. A set of 32 GPRs are available.
